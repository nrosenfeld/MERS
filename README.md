This group project, done by myself (Nathan Rosenfeld) together with Fangqing Yuan and Anusha Pathuri, is an analysis
of the spread of the MERS virus in Saudi Arabia. It uses a SARIMA model to model autoregression and seasonality in the
human incidence of the virus and  fits a partially observed Markov chain process to model the spread of the virus amoung
camels and its resultant spread among humans.
